# Fraud-Detection
A machine learning project designed to identify high-risk credit card transactions using behavioral analytics and anomaly detection.
After correcting data leakage by applying SMOTE within an imbalanced-learn pipeline after the train–test split, the stacking ensemble achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.956. The model demonstrates strong recall (0.91) on the minority fraud class, indicating effective detection of frauders while maintaining high precision.
